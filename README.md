# PowerPoint Progress Bar Macro

This macro allows you to create a progress bar at the bottom of each slide (except the title slide) to indicate how far into the presentation you are at any given slide.

See an example of this progress bar below:

## Usage

Launch the Visual Basic window in PowerPoint from the Developer tab in the ribbon. Import the `AddProgressBar.bas` file as a module and run the macro in it.

If you change the number of slides or change the slide order, you will need to re-run this macro to update the progress bars.
